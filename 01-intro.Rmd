## About me:

- I am a doctoral student in the department of Education studying quantitative methods at the University of California, Santa Barbara 
- I study the development and communication of mixture modeling methods in-line with my advisor Dr. Karen Nylund-Gibson's research.
- The materials used in this course have been adapted from content I developed as a teaching assistant for courses in `Factor Analysis`, `Structural Equation Modeling`, & `Applied Mixture Modeling` taught by Professor Nylund-Gibson. 

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **WHAT** is `MplusAutomation` & **WHY** schould we use it?

**WHAT?**

- `MplusAutomation` is an `R` package
- It “wraps around” the `Mplus` program
- Requires both `R` & `Mplus` software 
- Requires learning some basics of 2 programming languages
- Car metaphor: R/Rstudio is the *steering wheel or dashboard* & Mplus is the *engine*

**WHY?**

- As a data analyst using Mplus to analyze projects that often span multiple years I realized a need for clearly organized work procedures in which every research decision can be documented in a single place. 
- The motivation for using this method is to increase reproducibility, organization, efficiency, and transparency

**HOW?**

- We will interface entirely within R-Studio.
- The code presented will be very repetitive by design. Creating a consistent routine is key!

## Citing `R`, `Mplus`, & `MplusAutomation` 

- It is important to recognize & acknowledge the large contribution provided by these great resources. 
- This course is made possible by the availability of the following software:

R Core Team (2017). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL http://www.R-project.org/

Muthén, L.K. & Muthén, B.O. (1998-2017). Mplus User’s Guide. Eighth Edition. Los Angeles, CA: Muthén & Muthén

Hallquist, M. N., & Wiley, J. F. (2018). MplusAutomation: An R Package for Facilitating Large-Scale Latent Variable Analyses in Mplus. Structural equation modeling: a multidisciplinary journal, 25(4), 621-638.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals (estabishing a `routine`):

- The goal of this method is to have a self-contained project in a single location containing all relevant code for analysis and presentation of results.
- In the design of this course I considered the following 3 principles:

1. Accessibility
2. Communication
3. Organization 


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Participation

- To get the most out of the course **I highly recommend** following along during the recordings and writing/running the code yourself. Feel free to pause the recording to catch up or review any of the steps. 
- There is no substitute for practice. Learning `MplusAutomation` requires trial and error to memorize the routine (i.e., lots of repetition). 

All R scripts & materials can be downloaded at the Github repository found here:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scope of Course

- It is assumed that participants taking this course have previous experience with `R` & `Mplus`.
- The course will focus on procedures to implement a range of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analyses using `MplusAutomation`. 
- The conceptual or technical details of these models are beyond the scope of this course. 
- I will rely on tools such as `Rmarkdown` & `Github` for teaching purposes but no experience with these tools is necessary to follow or implement the analyses.

## Preparing to work with MplusAutomation - Tools for Reproducibility

*A Tidy Approach to MplusAutomation*

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse);library(gt)

tools <- tribble(
  ~"Tool/Package", ~"Purpose/Utility",  ~"Advantages",
 #---------------|-------------------|----------------|,
 "Mplus software" ,  "Comprehensive SEM modeling support" , "High modeling flexibility",
 "{MplusAutomation}",  "Conduit between R & Mplus" , "Organization & documentation",
 "R Project" ,  "Project containment" , "Ease of sharing or portability",
 "{here} package" , "Unbreakable/consistent file paths across OS" , "Reproducibility (for Science's sake!)",
 "{tidyverse} package" ,  "Intuitive/descriptive function names" , "Accessibility to new users & translation",
 "{haven} package" ,  "View-able metadata in R from SPSS data-files" , "Getting to know your measures",
 "{ggplot2} package" ,  "Clear, customizable, reproducible figures" , "Publication quality data visualizations",
 "pipe operator (%>%)", "Readable sequences of functions", "first() %>% and_then() %>% and_finally()",
 "Rmarkdown", "Integrating R code, text, output, and Latex", "Communication & presentation",
 "Github", "Version control & sharing repositories ", "Collaboration & accessability",
 "Project sub-folders", "Sorting large quantities of files", "Order, tidiness, & efficiency"
)

tools %>%
 gt() %>%
 tab_header(title = md("**Tools for Reproducibility - A Tidy Approach to MplusAutomation**"),
            subtitle = md("&nbsp;")) %>%
 tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = "bold") %>%
 tab_style(style = "padding-top:12px;padding-bottom:12px;",
           locations = list(cells_body(), cells_column_labels(), cells_title()))
  
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width = "100%", out.height= "100%", fig.pos="h"}
library(here)
knitr::include_graphics(here("01-intro", "mplus-auto-map.png"))
```

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A note about choosing the location of your project folder

- A good location is on the **desktop** or within a **single folder**. 
- Due to the fact that Mplus only reads the first 90 columns in each line an error will occur if the file-path is longer than this limit when using MplusAutomation to run models. 

`e.g., if/your/filepath/has/many/nested/folders/it/will/be/longer/than/the/90character//limit/data.dat`

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A note on coding style:

- Naming conventions: **Be consistent!** 
- I use the naming convention called *lower snake case* (e.g., `this_is_lower_snake_case`)
- Annotate code generously
- Let your code breath: use **return** often to spread code chunks out vertically
